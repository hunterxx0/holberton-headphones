## Implement a design from scratch
### Introduction

In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge that I learned previously.

I won’t have a lot of instruction, I'm free to implement it the way that I want 

### Objective

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

### Sections

- Header
- What we do...
- Our results
- Contact us
- Footer

### Requirements

- You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- You are not to use Javascript

### How to do it

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super-specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

### When it's done
